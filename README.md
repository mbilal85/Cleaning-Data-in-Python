# Cleaning-Data-in-Python
It's commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data and only 20% of their time analyzing it. The time spent cleaning is vital since analyzing dirty data can lead you to draw inaccurate conclusions. Data cleaning is an essential task in data science. Without properly cleaned data, the results of any data analysis or machine learning model could be inaccurate. Here, I've demonstrated how to identify, diagnose, and treat a variety of data cleaning problems in Python, ranging from simple to advanced. I have dealt with improper data types, checked that the data is in the correct range, handled missing data, performed record linkage, and more!
